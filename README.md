# VA-chatbot

This repo contains the code I wrote to build a simple chatbot agent with quantized Llama2 based off data from https://www.va.gov/. 

An example of usage of the modules can be found in the notebook ```chatbot_example.ipynb```.

The app can be run with chainlit ```run ask.py```, after installing dependencies in ```requirements.txt```.
